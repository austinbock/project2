 The client for this project is an anonymous manufacturing company that utilizes a plasma etch process tool to define a critical 
patterning that is measured against an expected requirement specification.  The measured delta to expected is defined as "Error".
The goal is to a classification algorithm which could be used on monitors to predict the likelihood of high 'Error' due to the condition of
the process chamber.  A secondary goal would be to determine if an unsupervised classifier could be used to monitor tool health and 
identify shifts that warrant shutdown for investigation.  A key factor in this analysis is that outside sources of noise on the 
process line are not available here so the analysis will assume the to be negligible, however this may not be true.

  All date/timestamps were removed from Error files and converted to a new sequential runs.  This was required to prevent exposure 
of factory metrics but retains the necessary sequential information required for this time series.  The Error columns were also 
normalized to also hide sensitive data and histogram indicate a normal process distribution centered about 0.  
Optical emission spectra were obtained from monitor runs and married to the subsequent
Error runID for labeling as anomaly/normal.  After converting the data into a pandas dataframe and combining the labels and optical emssion
into a dictionary, exploratory analysis was performed.  The # of features from optical emssion spectra is very large so care will need
to be taken to prevent memory issues and adequat algorithmn run times.
